# RockPaperScissors.
RockPaperScissors is a web-based JavaScript app involving a simple best-of-five game of rock paper scissors. The game is built on vanilla JavaScript and was my first exploration into Document Object Models (DOM) and using queries to influence the elements of a webpage.

## What I've learnt
### CSS
<ul>
  <li>Flexbox: Very useful for dynamic layouts</li>
  <li>Using responsive units: em responds better than px!</li>
</ul>

### JavaScript
<ul>
  <li>Document Object Models (DOM)</li>
  <li>Querying with JavaScript</li>
  <li>Dealing with function variable scopes</li>
  <li>Understanding and using conditionals</li>
  <li>Bugfixing unexpected errors that occur</li>
</ul>

### Other
<ul>
  <li>Visually appealing UI design</li>
</ul>
